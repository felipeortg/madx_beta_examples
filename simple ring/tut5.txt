The walkthrough the design of a storage ring for particles

Different elements compose the storage ring, but the ones that define the trajectory of the beam are principally magnets and RF cavities. As commonly in accelerators the beam is composed of charged particles it is easy to put electromagnets outside the beam so that we can modify it to comply with our requirements. First we have the dipoles, they produce a uniform magnetic field in a perpendicular direction of the motion producing a bend in the trajectory of particles. This bending is what makes possible to have a closed loop for our storage ring.

During the design and implementation of the madx software we began with a storage ring for protons, the characteristics were given in the tutorial 4 and some other quantities were calculated then like the needed number of dipoles given the maximum magnetic field we could reach.
Particles: Protons• Kinetic energy = 15 GeV• Circumference = 1000 m• Quadrupole length Lq = 3 m,• Dipole length = 5.0 m,• Maximum magnetic field in dipoles = 2.0 T, 
• 8 FODO cells.

In the first exercise we learnt how to define this dipoles, first as the thin lens approximation. The dipole strength is defined as knl in this case. In the figure \ref{fig:5_1} we can see both an open and a closed loop, in the first case the knell was defined as $2\pi$/64 and in the closed case as $2$2\pi$/32. We have defined 32 dipoles for the ring then is easy to see that \emph{knl} gives the bended angle by a dipole.

Exercise 1

Depending on the bending angle and the number of cells we can see if the beam closed a loop and also the length of the beam is determined.

The second exercise was about implementing the quadrupoles, in this case from the formula of the $\beta_{max}$, in which we are using the thin lens approximation for the quadrupoles we defined that for a 300m maximum we will need quadrupoles with a focal length of 112.5m. Following the formula $\frac{1}{f}=kL_q$ we used the quadrupole strength of 8.89e-3m$^2$. We can see in figure \ref{fig:5_2_th} the beta function along our ring. The maxima is 300m as we would expect from our calculations. The minima is 170m, and for one plane the maxima is located where the minima of the other plane and vice-versa. we can understand this from the fact that a quadrupole focuses in one plane and defocuses in the other. Then when $\beta_x$ is maxima is because it is in a focusing quadrupole and the $\beta_y$ gets its minima because it is being defocused.

Exercise 2

The formula is using thin lens approximation. The maximas are at the quadrupoles, where you get the pull from the magnet that change the amplitude of the beam. There are in opposite places as a quadrupole defocuses in one direction while it focuses in the other. 300m and 170m.

Changes because of the physical model of the dipole that helps to focus the beam in one of the directions.
